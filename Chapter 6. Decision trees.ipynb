    "**Model interpretation: white box versus black box:** Decision Trees are intuitive, and their decisions are easy to interpret. Such models are often called white box models. In contrast, as we will see, Random Forests or neural networks are generally considered black box models. They make great predictions, and you can easily check the calculations that they performed to make these predictions; nevertheless, it is usually hard to explain in simple terms why the predictions were made. For example, if a neural network says that a particular person appears on a picture, it is hard to know what contributed to this prediction: did the model recognize that person’s eyes? Their mouth? Their nose? Their shoes? Or even the couch that they were sitting on? Conversely, Decision Trees provide nice, simple classification rules that can even be applied manually if need be (e.g., for flower classification)."

Such a model is often called a nonparametric model, not because it does not have any parameters (it often has a lot) but because the number of parameters is not determined prior to training, so the model structure is free to stick closely to the data. In contrast, a parametric model, such as a linear model, has a predetermined number of parameters, so its degree of freedom is limited, reducing the risk of overfitting (but increasing the risk of underfitting)."
