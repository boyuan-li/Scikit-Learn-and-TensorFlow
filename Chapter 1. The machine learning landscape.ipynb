    "A model is a simplified version of the observations. The simplifications are meant to discard the superfluous details that are unlikely to generalize to new instances. To decide what data to discard and what data to keep, you must make assumptions. For example, a linear model makes the assumption that the data is fundamentally linear and that the distance between the instances and the straight line is just noise.\n",

    "If you make absolutely no assumption about the data, then there is no reason to prefer one model over any other, this is called the no free lunch theorem. For some datasets, the best model is a linear model, while for other datasets, it is a neural network. There is no model that is a priori guaranteed to work better. The only way to know for sure which model is best is to evaluate them all. Since this is not possible, in practice you make some reasonable assumptions about the data and evaluate only a few reasonable models. For example, for simple tasks you may evaluate linear models with various levels of regularization, and for a complex problem you may evaluate various neural networks"
